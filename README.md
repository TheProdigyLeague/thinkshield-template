ThinkShield: Key Components
ThinkShield is Lenovo's comprehensive security portfolio, providing a multi-layered defense to protect devices from end to end. Its key components can be summarized into the following categories:
1. Supply Chain Security
Zero Trust Supply Chain: Lenovo vets all components from the manufacturing stage to prevent tampering and ensure hardware integrity.
Build Assure: Provides customers with a clear record of the components and certifications of their device at the point of manufacture, allowing for verification of authenticity.
2. Hardware and Firmware Protection
Trusted Platform Module (TPM): A dedicated hardware chip that protects cryptographic keys and other sensitive data, establishing a hardware-based "root of trust."
Self-healing BIOS: Automatically detects and restores unauthorized changes to the BIOS, protecting against low-level firmware attacks.
Physical Security Features: Includes built-in privacy shutters for webcams, match-on-chip fingerprint readers, and IR cameras for facial recognition to prevent physical access and "shoulder surfing" attacks.
Smart USB Protection: Restricts data transfer functions on USB ports to prevent unauthorized access and data exfiltration.
3. Software and Data Protection
Data Encryption: Provides solutions for encrypting data on hard drives and in the cloud.
AI-Powered Endpoint Protection: Integrates with security software like SentinelOne to defend against malware and ransomware with real-time detection and response.
Identity and Access Management: Utilizes biometric authentication, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and FIDO-certified authenticators to secure user logins.
4. Security Management
Centralized Control: Allows IT teams to remotely manage and enforce security policies across a fleet of devices.
Firmware Assurance: Provides visibility into the status of firmware, helping to identify and remediate vulnerabilities.
Secure Erase: Enables remote wiping of data from a lost or stolen device.
