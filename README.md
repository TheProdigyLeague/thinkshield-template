# ThinkShield: Key Components

ThinkShield is Lenovo's comprehensive security portfolio, providing a multi-layered defense to protect devices from end to end. Its key components can be summarized into the following categories:

1. **Supply Chain Security**
**Zero Trust Supply Chain:** Lenovo vets all components from the manufacturing stage 🏭 to prevent tampering 🚫 and ensure hardware integrity 🛡️.
**Build Assure:** Provides customers with a clear record 📝 of the components ⚙️ and certifications 📜 of their device at the point of manufacture, allowing for verification of authenticity ✅.

2. **Hardware and Firmware Protection**
**Trusted Platform Module (TPM):** A dedicated hardware chip that protects cryptographic keys and other sensitive data, establishing a hardware-based "root of trust." 🔐
Self-healing BIOS: Automatically detects and restores unauthorized changes to the BIOS, protecting against low-level firmware attacks. 🛡️
**Physical Security Features:** Includes built-in privacy shutters for webcams, match-on-chip fingerprint readers, and IR cameras for facial recognition to prevent physical access and "shoulder surfing" attacks. 🕶️
Smart USB Protection: Restricts data transfer functions on USB ports to prevent unauthorized access and data exfiltration. 🚫

4. **Software and Data Protection**
**Data Encryption:** Provides solutions for encrypting data on hard drives and in the cloud. 🔐
**AI-Powered Endpoint Protection:** Integrates with security software like SentinelOne to defend against malware and ransomware with real-time detection and response. 🛡️
**Identity and Access Management:** Utilizes biometric authentication, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and FIDO-certified authenticators to secure user logins. 🔐

5. **Security Management**
**Centralized Control:** Allows IT teams to remotely manage and enforce security policies across a fleet of devices 💻.
**Firmware Assurance:** Provides visibility into the status of firmware, helping to identify and remediate vulnerabilities 🛡️.
**Secure Erase:** Enables remote wiping of data from a lost or stolen device 🚫.
